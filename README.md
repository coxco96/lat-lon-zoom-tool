# Lat/lon + Zoom Tool
## Created with React

- I created this map, my first React app, using Mapbox GL JS.
- The code was adapted from a Mapbox tutorial.
- This map responds to user interaction, allowing the user to quickly identify the lat/lon coordinates and map zoom level of the map.
- This map is useful for identifying the desired lat/lon and zoom points when initializing your own map.
